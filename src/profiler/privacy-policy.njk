    <h3 class="open-sans bold" style="color: #007876; margin-top: 1.5rem;">Overview</h3>
    <p>Profiler is a multiplayer party game developed by TomKat Creative. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.</p>

    <h3 class="open-sans bold" style="color: #007876; margin-top: 1.5rem;">Data We Collect</h3>

    <p><strong>Authentication.</strong> If you sign in with Google or Apple, we receive your display name and a unique account identifier. If you skip sign-in and play as a guest, no account information is collected.</p>

    <p><strong>Game statistics.</strong> For signed-in users, we store gameplay stats (games played, wins, accuracy, opponents) in Cloud Firestore so you can track your progress. Anonymous guests can play but no stats are saved.</p>

    <p><strong>Camera.</strong> The app requests camera access solely to scan QR codes for joining game sessions. No images or video are captured, stored, or transmitted.</p>

    <p><strong>Local network.</strong> The app uses your device's local WiFi network to host or join game sessions via WebSocket. Your local IP address is shared only with other players on the same network during a game session.</p>

    <h3 class="open-sans bold" style="color: #007876; margin-top: 1.5rem;">Data We Do Not Collect</h3>
    <ul style="padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 2;">
      <li>We do not collect location data</li>
      <li>We do not serve advertisements</li>
      <li>We do not sell or share personal data with third parties</li>
      <li>We do not use analytics or tracking SDKs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="open-sans bold" style="color: #007876; margin-top: 1.5rem;">Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>Profiler uses Firebase (by Google) for authentication and data storage. Firebase's data handling is governed by <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h3 class="open-sans bold" style="color: #007876; margin-top: 1.5rem;">Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h3>
    <p>Game statistics are retained as long as your account exists. You may request deletion of your data by contacting us. Deleting the app removes all local data from your device.</p>

    <h3 class="open-sans bold" style="color: #007876; margin-top: 1.5rem;">Children's Privacy</h3>
    <p>Profiler is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.</p>

    <h3 class="open-sans bold" style="color: #007876; margin-top: 1.5rem;">Changes to This Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with a revised date.</p>
